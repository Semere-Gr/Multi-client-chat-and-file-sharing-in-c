When transferring a file, the two parties, or clients, who are exchanging the file should be in different directory.

for example, if I want to transfer a file from client A to client B, A and B should be in different directory(because it creates an infinte loop if they are in the same directory). and the file should be stored in the same directory as where the sender is in.

NOTE:
it is possible to send file between two clients whose .c file is in two different, not the same, directories.

so, run one or more 'client_proj.c' in a directory where the files are(here the clients can be sender). then, copy and run'client_proj.c' from another directory(here the clients can receive a file).


one text file and two image files of different formats are provided for testing.
